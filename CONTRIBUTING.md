# Contributing to Katze Social

We’re excited you’re here! This guide will help you get productive quickly and submit great pull requests.

## How to contribute

- Report bugs and request features by opening issues
- Tackle a good first issue or help triage existing ones
- Submit pull requests for fixes, tests, docs, or enhancements

If you’re unsure about an approach, open a draft PR early for feedback.

 ## Development setup (5 minutes)

 ```bash
 npm install
npx patch-package
npm run web   # or: npm run android | npm run ios
 ```

See ```DEVELOPER.md``` for environment variables, tests, and troubleshooting.

 ## Pull request checklit

Before you submit:
- [ ] Runs locally: npm run web (or on device)
- [ ] Type checks pass: npm run typecheck
- [ ] Lint passes: npm run lint (consider npx eslint . --fix)
- [ ] Updated docs if behavior or setup changed
- [ ] Small, focused PR with a descriptive title

PR tips:
- Prefer small, incremental PRs over mega-PRs
- Add screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes
- Mark as Draft if still iterating

## Issue guidelines

When filing an issue, please include:
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment (web/Android/iOS, OS, versions)
- Logs or screenshots if helpful

## Code style

- TypeScript preferred where applicable
- Keep code readable and well-named; avoid unnecessary complexity
- Add tests for critical logic and regression risks
